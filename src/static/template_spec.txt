# ParliamentDiagram Template Specification v1.1

A template describes a diagram, containing seats to be colored or otherwise styled.

There may only be a fixed number of seats per template.

A template file must be of the SVG format, and in addition,
use the "http://parliamentdiagram.toolforge.org/2024/template" namespace whose use will be described further down.
The namespace will be nicknamed "Namespace" further down, and be assumed to be prefixed as "pardiag" in code snippets,
although neither are mandatory in any way.

Each seat must be represented with an SVG element supporting the fill, stroke and stroke-width attributes.
Each seat's element should also support the <title> and <desc> sub-elements.

Each seat's element must have a "pardiag:seatnumber" parameter that is unique in value across the template.
The values of the parameter must be strings, as per the SVG standard, and represent positive integral numbers.
The ordering of the seat numbers should be meaningful, ideally from left to right,
where "left" and "right" may bhave different meanings depending on the template.

The seat numbers do not need to be continuous and may start at any value.
For example, a template could only contain a seat n°5 and a seat n°16.
For style and readability purposes however, seat numbers should start at 0 and be continuous.

## Metadata

Templates may contain metadata, stored as Namespace parameters to the root SVG node.
The metadata parameters must not be added to any other node.

The "pardiag:reversed" parameter is a boolean metadata parameter.
It being absent or set to the empty string indicates a falsey value,
any other value indicates a truthy value.
In a reversed template, the meaning of the ordering of the seat numbers is reversed,
starting from "right" to "left".

The "paradiag:name" provides the name of the template. It is entirely optional.
